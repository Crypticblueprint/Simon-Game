# Simon-Game

## Matching Memory Game

### The Game:
Simon uses a series of 4 tones and 4 flashing lights to construct a sequence.
The objective of the player is to replicate this sequence, just like
in a game of Simon Says. 

### The Start and game play:
When the start button is pressed, Simon begins by flashing 
one of the 4 buttons accompanyed by a tone. 
The player's objective is to repeat this sequence.
If the player repeats the sequence correctly, Simon continues
by adding a new flashing light and tone to the current sequence.  
If the player is able to replicate a pattern sequence of 20,
the player wins! Simple!
